# 📘 Python Exercises List (Structured Paradigm)

This repository contains a collection of **25 Python exercises**
developed to practice the **structured programming paradigm**.\
The main goal is to strengthen programming fundamentals using only:

-   Simple variables\
-   Conditional structures\
-   Loops\
-   Lists and matrices\
-   Simple modularization

⚠️ **Restrictions:**\
- Do not use **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.\
- Do not use **complex functions** beyond the basics.\
- Do not rely on **sophisticated external libraries**.

## 📝 Exercises

1.  Read a number `n` and print all even numbers from `1` to `n`.\
2.  Read a string and count how many vowels it contains.\
3.  Read 5 numbers, store them in a list, and sort them manually
    (without `sort()`).\
4.  Read an integer and calculate the sum of its digits. (Ex:
    `1234 → 10`)\
5.  Read a number `n` and print its multiplication table from `1` to
    `10`.\
6.  Read 10 numbers and display the largest and smallest (without
    `max()` or `min()`).\
7.  Countdown from `n` to `0`, showing `"END!"` at the end.\
8.  Convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.\
9.  Read a `3x3` matrix and print its transpose.\
10. Show all prime numbers within the interval `[a, b]`.\
11. Simulate an ATM, showing the minimum number of bills for a
    withdrawal.\
12. Calculate the factorial of `n` (without recursion).\
13. Check if a word is a palindrome (e.g., `"arara"`, `"radar"`).\
14. Generate an identity matrix of size `n x n`.\
15. Calculate a student's weighted average grade.\
16. Guessing game (number between `1 and 100`).\
17. Numerical integration of a function using the **trapezoid rule**.\
18. Simulate the hangman game.\
19. Check if a `9x9` matrix is a valid Sudoku solution.\
20. Simulate an election (candidate A, B, null, blank) and generate
    statistics.\
21. Represent a maze as a matrix and check if the player finds the
    exit.\
22. Convert numbers from `1 to 3999` into Roman numerals.\
23. Calculate the determinant of a `3x3` matrix.\
24. Simulate bank accounts (deposit, withdraw, balance) **without
    OOP**.\
25. Recognize the regular expression **`(a|b)*abb`** using finite
    automata.
